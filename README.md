# Note-taker-app
This is a project showcasing my ability to use Node, Express, and MySQL to make a note-taking app.

<h1>Hello TA grading this!</h1>
<p>I know that the app is broken right now. That's why I haven't hosted it on heroku yet. Once it is all up and running, I will fix this!</p>

<p>As of right now, localhost:3000/api/notes is loading the notes as an array of objects on the page, though.</p>

<p>Until then, this is the best I could do for now! Have a nice day!</p>
